## Contributing Code

### Getting Started

It is highly recommended that you become familiar with using Swift in your own projects before contributing directly to the language itself. We put together handy [Getting Started][get_started] guides with step-by-step instructions to get you up and running. You should also know how to build Swift [from source](https://www.swift.org/documentation/source-code)

### Process

Many of the repositories in github.com/swiftlang have a CONTRIBUTING.md in the root of the repository or in the README. This is your pathway to submitting pull requests, getting code reviewed, and more. Many will follow the standards set in the [/swift/CONTRIBUTING.md] if there is not a specific process listed.
